/*
    This exercise is designed to demonstrate why the atomicity guaranteed by opening
    a file with the O_APPEND flag is necessary. Write a program that takes up to three
    command-line arguments:
    $ atomic_append filename num-bytes [x]
    This file should open the specified filename (creating it if necessary) and append
    num-bytes bytes to the file by using write() to write a byte at a time. 
    
    By default, the program should open the file with the O_APPEND flag, but if a third command-line
    argument (x) is supplied, then the O_APPEND flag should be omitted, and instead the
    program should perform an lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END) call before each write(). 
    
    Run two instances of this program at the same time without the x argument to write
    1 million bytes to the same file:
    $ atomic_append f1 1000000 & atomic_append f1 1000000
 
    Repeat the same steps, writing to a different file, but this time specifying the x
    argument:
    $ atomic_append f2 1000000 x & atomic_append f2 1000000 x
  
    List the sizes of the files f1 and f2 using ls â€“l and explain the difference.
